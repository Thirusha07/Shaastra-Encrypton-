Behavioral Analytics for Detecting Anomalies in Financial Transactions 
problem Statement:
     Implement and improve behavioral analytics solutions that can detect anomalies in financial transactions, providing enhanced security against fraudulent activities.

Working Principle:
    Our chosen anomaly detection approach employs an isolated forest machine learning model, leveraging unsupervised ensemble learning. This model isolates anomalies within finance transaction data subsets, utilizing feature influence and importance, and supports hyperparameter tuning for optimal performance.
